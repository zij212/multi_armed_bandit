I was reading and learning about the following three approaches to address Multi-Armed Bandit Problem.
- $\epsilon$-greedy  
- UCB1
- Thompson Sampling

The following resources provided great help in explaining and implementing the algorithms
- Udemy Class - [Bayesian Machine Learning in Python: A/B Testing](https://www.udemy.com/course/bayesian-machine-learning-in-python-ab-testing/)  
  Class [Repo](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/blob/master/ab_testing/bayesian_bandit.py)
- Blog Post - ["The Multo-Armed Bandit Problem and Its Solutions" by Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html)
